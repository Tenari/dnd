# Wuxia: Chinese Martial Arts Fantasy

In Wuxia, martial artists cultivate chi to become more powerful, eventually seeking to ascend. There are rare herbs, secret techiniques, magical pills and elixirs, storage rings, flying swords, talking dragons, and much more. The first step is to become a cultivator (a martial artist who can control chi), and choose a path.

## Character Creation

1. Name your character. Choose your Gender.
2. How old were you when you learned to absorb chi? (5-50 years) Also fill in your height.
3. Choose your family background:
    - large/medium/small clan
    - Noble/artisan/peasant family
    - farming/fishing/mining/capital town
4. How did you learn? personal meditation | family teaching | martial arts practice | alchemical pill/natural treasure
5. Roll your [Base Stats](#base-stats).
6. [Choose a Path](#path)
7. [Choose a Master at the Sect](#arrival-at-the-sect)
8. Fill out your Techniques

#### Base Stats

The Stats are Strength, Quickness, Intelligence, Charisma, Tranquility. You start out with a 0 in all of them. You get some bonuses for family background:

- large clan: +1 to Charisma
- medium clan: +1 to Tranquility
- small clan: +1 to Intelligence

- Noble family: +1 to Intelligence
- Artisan family: +1 to Quickness
- Peasant family: +1 to Strength

- Farming village: +1 to Tranquility
- Fishing village: +1 to Quickness
- Mining town: +1 to Strength
- Capital City: +1 to Charisma

- Personal Meditation: +1 to Tranquility
- Family Teaching: +1 to Charisma
- Martial Arts Practice: +1 to Strength
- Alchemical Pill: +1 to Intelligence

Then roll 2d4 for each stat and take the higher number, and add it to whatever family bonuses you got. Odds the highest number your roll for a given stat produces:

1. 6.25%
2. 18.75%
3. 31.25%
4. 43.75%

point-buy system:

You start with 21 points to spend across all attributes

1. costs 1 point
2. costs 1 more point
3. costs 2 more points
4. costs 3 more points

#### Path

When you first learn to absorb chi from the world into your body, you must choose what kind of chi you wish to cultivate:

- Pure
- Wood / Life
- Fire
- Water
- Metal
- Earth
- Air = wood + fire
- Blood = wood + water
- Force = wood + metal
- Gravity = wood + earth
- Lightning = fire + water
- Light = fire + metal
- Lava = fire + earth
- Ice = water + Air
- Decay = water + metal
- Acid = water + earth
- Dark = metal + earth

Each kind of chi has its own strengths and weaknesses.

Now fill in your Path name. There are pre-suggested paths (listed in a different section), but if you wish to forge your own way, just invent whatever path name suits you.

#### Arrival at the Sect

You have shown promise, since only about 10% of people ever manage to learn to absorb chi. As such, your family has sent you to the nation's cultivation sect to be trained, and bring honor to the family name. You have the option of refusing, and becoming a wandering cultivator if you choose, but it is the harder path, and not necessarily a better one.

Assuming you choose to go to the Sect, you must choose your Sect Master when you arrive. This elder will be your mentor and guide, and will greatly influence which techniques you gain access to. Your DM will tell you the name of your Sect if all players are at the same Sect, or will give you a choice if you are starting split up. He will also have names for your available Sect Masters, since not all Sects have the full set of Masters.

Sect Masters:

- Unarmed Martial Master
- Dagger Martial Master
- Sword Martial Master
- Club/Mace/Hammer Master
- Staff/Spear Martial Master
- Throwing Martial Master
- Bow Martial Master
- Alchemical Master
- Smithing Master
- Enchanting Master

#### Starting Techinques

Techinques are either combat or non-combat powers/abilities that you can use. Often they use up chi. Aside from extremely basic actions that everyone can take, nearly every action is a technique you must learn.

They can be learned from an NPC or character that knows them, or from a technique manual or path manual. (A Path manual will contain multiple techniques in the same vein). To learn a technique, you must meet the minimum requirements, and make an **attempt**. (Roll a d20 and add your relevant stat modifier, and subtract the listed amount of chi). If you succeed the technique DC, you learn it, if not, you must try again. Once you know a technique, you add it to your techniques list.

Each time you use a technique, you increase your `uses` stat in the technique block by one. Techniques grow in mastery with each use, and grow more powerful at each mastery level. "Successfull" uses for a combat technique means landing the hit. Unsuccessfull uses will grow your `uses` stat additionally, since you learn more from failure.

- incompetent: 0-9 uses
- mediocre: 10-99 uses
- competent: 100 - 999 uses
- innovative: 1k - 9,999 uses
- masterful: 10k+ uses

Everyone learns a Basic Strike attack (either a kick or punch) growing up, so that is already on your character sheet.

Upon accepting you as a student, your Sect Master will teach you a starting techinque in his domain:

- Unarmed Martial Master: Basic Chi Strike
- Dagger Martial Master: Basic Stab
- Sword Martial Master: Basic Slash
- Club/Mace/Hammer Master: Basic Swing
- Staff/Spear Martial Master: Basic Block
- Throwing Martial Master: Basic Throw
- Bow Martial Master: Basic Shot
- Alchemical Master: Chi Neutralization
- Smithing Master: Basic Shaping
- Enchanting Master: Alarm Formation

## Progression

Instead of levels 1 to 30 like in DnD, in this game, you progress through different stages of enlightenment, eventually becoming an immortal. Within each stage, you must grow your core until it can contain enough chi to spend it to advance. You grow your core primarily by "purifying" which just means spending all your chi at once to reinforce your body. Each purification lets you roll 1d6 to expand your core's capacity and costs all the chi you can contain. If you spend a day cultivating, you can fill your core completely. Since this is a somewhat slow method to progress, items like monster cores and magical pills are very helpful in providing chi that you can use to quickly purify multiple times in a row.

Earthly realm:
- iron
- copper
- silver
- gold 

Precious realm:
- marble
- jade
- opal
- diamond 

Heavenly realm:
- heavenly messenger
- heavenly warrior
- heavenly ruler 

Immortal

## Basic Gameplay

A session typically starts out at the Sect. Each player decides what training they will pursue. Typical options are: Cultivating, lesson with master to learn a technique, practicing an already learned technique, or crafting something (pill/weapon/formation, etc). The player rolls (if necessary) to see the results of their training and updates their stats sheet, and removes contribution points as necessary.

This continues until the players want to, or need to, take a job to earn contribution points. Everyone who wants to go goes off on the job/mission/adventure and it's much more like typical dnd. Hunt down the bandits, fight them in turn-based dnd-style combat rolling some d20, etc, get the loot, and return to the Sect.

Often, the loot will include monster cores or other progression items, which the players can either use themselves or sell back to the Sect for points.

Then the cycle repeats, of training until the group wants to venture out again.

## Paths

The format for a path overview description is:

The Path Name

| Item | Detail |
| ---  | ---    |
| Highest Level attained | cultivation level of the founder/strongest practicioner |
| Main Weapon            | Unarmed/dagger/sword/blunt/pole/thrown/bow              |
| Rarity                 | Common/Uncommon/Rare/Extinct                            |
| Focus                  | Combat/Alchemical/Smithing/Gardening/Enchanting         |

**Highest Level attained** this does not limit how high you personally could advance, it just means that the path ends at that level and you'd be left to find your own way beyond it.

**Main Weapon** the weapon which the path has the most techniques for. Not required to use it and still be a member of the path, but highly recommended.

**Rarity** affects how difficult it is to find path manuals and instructors and fellow practicioners to learn from.

**Focus** What the path will help you succeed the most at. Not every path is for pure combat.

## Items

Gear is really important to being powerful in this world. Without pills and elixirs to progress, or magical weapons and armor to fight, or formations and talismans for protection, you won't be much of a threat.

#### Weapons

There are six weapon classes:

| class | range | base damage | cost |
| ---   | ---   | ---         | ---  |
| dagger    | melee | d6 | low  |
| sword     | melee | d8 | high |
| blunt     | melee | d6 | med  |
| pole      | 5/10  | d6 | low  |
| throwable | 20/40 | d4 | med  |
| bow       | 40/80 | d6 | high |

range numbers mean accurate range/penalty range (in feet), where you take a -2 to hit when at penalty range.

#### Armor

#### Formations

#### Pills and Elixirs

## dev notes

when a player logs into the game and they don't have a character yet, they can either be DM or make a character

when they already have a character, they see the main player page

main player page shows:
- character sheet/info
- grip map if relevant
- daily options if relevant

main DM page shows:
- characters in game with summary stats,
- combat grid if relevant
- command line for manipulating player state, advancing the day
- command line helper commands list

so there are two 'modes' I need to handle:
- home base mode (cultivation, training, crafting)
- adventuring mode
