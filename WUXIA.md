# Wuxia: Chinese Martial Arts Fantasy

In Wuxia, martial artists cultivate chi to become more powerful, eventually seeking to ascend. There are rare herbs, secret techiniques, magical pills and elixirs, storage rings, flying swords, talking dragons, and much more. The first step is to become a cultivator (a martial artist who can control chi), and choose a path.

## Character Creation

1. Name your character. Choose your Gender.
2. How old were you when you learned to absorb chi? (5-50 years) Also fill in your height.
3. Choose your family background:
    - large/medium/small clan
    - Noble/artisan/peasant family
    - farming/fishing/mining/capital town
4. How did you learn? personal meditation | family teaching | martial arts practice | alchemical pill/natural treasure
5. Roll your [Base Stats](#base-stats).
6. [Choose a Path](#path)
7. [Choose a Master at the Sect](#arrival-at-the-sect)
8. Fill out your Techniques

#### Base Stats

The Stats are Strength, Quickness, Intelligence, Charisma, Tranquility. You start out with a 0 in all of them. You get some bonuses for family background:

- large clan: +1 to Charisma
- medium clan: +1 to Tranquility
- small clan: +1 to Intelligence

- Noble family: +1 to Intelligence
- Artisan family: +1 to Quickness
- Peasant family: +1 to Strength

- Farming village: +1 to Strength
- Fishing village: +1 to Quickness
- Mining town: +1 to Strength
- Capital City: +1 to Charisma

Then roll 2d4 for each stat and take the higher number, and add it to whatever family bonuses you got.

#### Path

When you first learn to absorb chi from the world into your body, you must choose what kind of chi you wish to cultivate:

- Pure
- Wood / Life
- Fire
- Water
- Metal
- Earth
- Air = wood + fire
- Blood = wood + water
- Force = wood + metal
- Gravity = wood + earth
- Lightning = fire + water
- Light = fire + metal
- Lava = fire + earth
- Ice = water + Air
- Decay = water + metal
- Acid = water + earth
- Dark = metal + earth

Each kind of chi has its own strengths and weaknesses.

Now fill in your Path name. There are pre-suggested paths (listed in a different section), but if you wish to forge your own way, just invent whatever path name suits you.

#### Arrival at the Sect

You have shown promise, since only about 10% of people ever manage to learn to absorb chi. As such, your family has sent you to the nation's cultivation sect to be trained, and bring honor to the family name. You have the option of refusing, and becoming a wandering cultivator if you choose, but it is the harder path, and not necessarily a better one.

Assuming you choose to go to the Sect, you must choose your Sect Master when you arrive. This elder will be your mentor and guide, and will greatly influence which techniques you gain access to. Your DM will tell you the name of your Sect if all players are at the same Sect, or will give you a choice if you are starting split up. He will also have names for your available Sect Masters, since not all Sects have the full set of Masters.

Sect Masters:

- Unarmed Martial Master
  - Basic Chi Strike
- Dagger Martial Master
  - Basic Chi Stab
- Sword Martial Master
  - Basic Chi Slash
- Club/Mace/Hammer Master
  - Basic Chi Swing
- Staff/Spear Martial Master
  - Basic Chi Block
- Throwing Martial Master
  - Basic Chi Throw
- Bow Martial Master
  - Basic Chi Shot
- Alchemical Master
- Gardening Master
- Smithing Master
- Enchanting Master

#### Starting Techinques

Techinques are either combat or non-combat powers/abilities that you can use. Often they use up chi. They can be learned from an NPC or character that knows them, or from a technique or path manual. (A Path manual will contain multiple techniques in the same vein). To learn a technique, you must meet the minimum requirements, and make an **attempt**. (Roll a d20 and add your relevant stat modifier, and subtract the listed amount of chi). If you succeed the technique DC, you learn it, if not, you must try again. Once you know a technique, you add it to your techniques list. Each time you use it successfully, you increase your `uses` stat in the technique block by one. Techniques grow in mastery with each use, and grow more powerful at each mastery level.

Everyone learns a Basic Strike attack (either a kick or punch) growing up, so that is already on your character sheet.

Upon accepting you as a student, your Sect Master will teach you a basic chi-technique in his domain.

Immortal

within each stage, you must grow your core until it can contain enough chi to spend it to advance. You grow your core primarily by "purifying" which just means spending all your chi at once to reinforce your body. Each purification lets you roll 1d6 to expand your core's capacity

## Basic Game Cyle

go on adventure/quest. get loot of monster cores/items. absorb chi from cores

## Paths

The format for a path overview description is:

The Path Name

| Item | Detail |
| ---  | ---    |
| Highest Level attained | cultivation level of the founder/strongest practicioner |
| Main Weapon            | Unarmed/dagger/sword/blunt/staff/thrown/bow             |
| Rarity                 | Common/Uncommon/Rare/Extinct                            |
| Focus                  | Combat/Alchemical/Smithing/Gardening/Enchanting         |

**Highest Level attained** this does not limit how high you personally could advance, it just means that the path ends at that level and you'd be left to find your own way beyond it.

**Main Weapon** the weapon which the path has the most techniques for. Not required to use it and still be a member of the path, but highly recommended.

**Rarity** affects how difficult it is to find path manuals and instructors and fellow practicioners to learn from.

**Focus** What the path will help you succeed the most at. Not every path is for pure combat.
